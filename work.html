<p>  I made a body paragraph describing myself and what I do. I used canvas and svg elements to make art for my website.
      I used an audio file from a game to include in my portfolio.
      I typed an essay and included it as a pdf file in my website for everyone to read.
      I also included an video file to show people my favorite anime opening.
      I have made my website to fit properly on my screen at any size.
      I included a navigation bar to go to links like this work page.
      I did this because I wanted to improve my coding and wanted to see what I created.
