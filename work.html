<p> I have made my website to fit properly on my screen at any size. I made a body paragraph describing myself and what I do. I used canvas and svg elements to make art for my website. I used an audio file from a game to include in my portfolio. I typed an essay and included it as a pdf file in my website for everyone to read. I also included an video file to show people my favorite anime opening.
