    <p>About Me: I've lived in Flordia for most of my life with my two brothers and many other family members.
      I Graduated from Barron Collier High School and now I'm taking classes in Flordia Gulf Coast University.
      I plan on graduating and going to make or design video games, because I have a deep passion for them.
      I worked as a server at a local resteruant called Crispers ans i was a Counselor at a camp in North Carolina called High Rocks.
