    <p element= "p" >About Me: My name is Benjamin Zeitler, I go by Ben. I've lived in Flordia for most of my life with my two brothers and many other family members.
      I graduated from Barron Collier High School and now I'm taking classes in Flordia Gulf Coast University.
      I plan on graduating and going to make or design video games, because I have a deep passion for them.
      I worked as a server at a local resteruant called Crispers and I was a counselor at a camp in North Carolina
      called High Rocks.
      I'm a huge video game nerd enthusiast, my most favorite game right now is Shadow of the Colossus. 
      I like to play tennis and I like to get along well with others.
      I'm also a good rock climber since I got a lot of experience from my camping days.
      My favorite foods are burgers, pizza, ice cream, and cinnamon pretzels.
      I also like to watch movies that are action packed like Marvel and Star Wars.
      Love to watch anime, I like the art, storytelling, and characters in each anime I watch.
