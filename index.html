    <p>About Me: My name is Benjamin Zeitler, I go by Ben. I've lived in Flordia for most of my life with my two brothers and many other family members.
      I Graduated from Barron Collier High School and now I'm taking classes in Flordia Gulf Coast University.
      I plan on graduating and going to make or design video games, because I have a deep passion for them.
      I worked as a server at a local resteruant called Crispers ans i was a Counselor at a camp in North Carolina
      called High Rocks.
      I'm a huge video game nerd enthusiast, my most favorite game right now is Shadow of the Colossus. 
      I like to play tennis and I like to get along well with others.
      I'm also a good rock climber since I got a lot of experience from my camping days.
      My favorite foods are burgers, pizza, ice cream, and cinnamon pretzels.
